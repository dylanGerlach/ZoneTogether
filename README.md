# ZoneTogether

A collaborative project management tool for teams.

## Background

Currently, there is no easy or organized way for communities to report and coordinate the removal of trash or debris in their local areas. 
Most people either ignore the problem or rely on city services that take a long time to respond, especially when the issue is not officially reported. 
The idea behind ZoneTogether is to close that gap by giving the community a simple way to work together and take action faster. 
This app creates a shared space where organizers can plan cleanup zones and volunteers can join in and report what they find. 
Turns what is usually an individual or city-only responsibility into a community effort. The business case is that it saves time, encourages civic engagement, and helps keep cities cleaner without adding more burden to local governments. 
Our team saw this as a real opportunity to make community service more accessible and coordinated.
